# Optional Hardware-Accelerated Packages
#
# These packages provide CPU acceleration for ONNX Runtime and OpenVINO model inference.
# GPU acceleration has been removed due to compatibility issues.
#
# ONNX Runtime (CPU) - All platforms:
#   - onnxruntime>=1.15.0
#
# OpenVINO Support (Intel CPU only):
#   - openvino>=2023.0.0
#
# To install with hardware acceleration:
#   pip install -r requirements.txt -r requirements-hardware.txt
#
# Or use setup.py extras:
#   pip install .[hardware]      # Install all recommended for your hardware
#   pip install .[onnx]          # Install ONNX Runtime only
#   pip install .[openvino]      # Install OpenVINO only (Intel CPUs)

# Uncomment the package(s) appropriate for your hardware.
